        <h2>Explanation of the project:</h2>
        <p>In this task we were assigned to create a roller coaster made of paper which would roll a marble through loops, funnels, and drops. The task of this project was to create the most fluid and entertaining roller coaster possible. This project has 3 rules that we had to follow and it had categories where we could earn points.</p>
        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All the materials needed to be bought from the teacher, from a budget of $4000</li>
            <li>The project needed a theme</li>
            <li>The project needed to have a everyday report made by the leader</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Categories:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Fastest roller coaster</li>
            <li>Most fluid roller coaster</li>
            <li>Highest vertical drop</li>
            <li>Fastest time down a plain track</li>
            <li>E.t.c</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My Tasks:</h2>
        <p>As this was a group assignment, we were given roles and responsibilities around the task. My role was the <strong>builder</strong>. Other roles included <strong>leader</strong>, <strong>designer</strong>, and the <strong>negotiator</strong>. My main responsibility was to take the design by the designer and to create a roller coaster reassembling it. However, these roles were not obsolete, and anyone could help with anything.</p>

        <h2>My Contributions:</h2>
        <p>My contribution to this project was to physically build it. Firstly I started off with creating the loops and funnels so we could start assembling the roller coaster. Then I started creating the roller coasters. A piece of ingenuity that we had was buying the columns, which were cheaper than tracks, and cutting it in half. The brought our costs down. Another contribution of mine was to make another track and to make a cushioning system for the roller coaster. This was done to make our roller coaster stand out more.</p>

        <h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
        <p>In the end, our roller coaster won categories such as: fastest time down a track, highest vertical drop, and most loops. Our theme was a docking bay with a makeshift elevator, turning into a giant jellyfish.</p>
