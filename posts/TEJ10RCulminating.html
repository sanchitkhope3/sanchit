  <h1>TEJ Culminating Dragster</h1>

  <h2>Name: Sanchit Khope</h2>

  <h3>Explanation of the Project:</h3>
  <p>
    This project was my culminating project for grade 9 TEJ10R, where we had to create a dragster out of foam. This car needed to have the least amount of friction and be as aerodynamic as possible. To build this, we first had to research what makes a car aerodynamic and what makes it go as fast. Then we were to make our design on Onshape, and finally, we built it.

  <h2>Research:</h2>
  <p>
    While researching, one of the cars that stood out the most was the <strong>McLaren Speedtail</strong> and the <strong>Tatra T77A</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Speedtail was low to the ground and was thin.</li>
    <li>The Tatra was smooth and had a rounded back.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Based on these designs, I made some drawings and went on to create the design on <strong>Onshape</strong>.

  <h2>Final Product:</h2>
  <p>
    My first copy was exactly like the OnShape design I had made. However, it did not perform adequately in the trials, so I lowered the weight and size. Thus I made some adjustments.
  </p>

  <h3>Improvements Made From Original:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sanded the corners to reduce drag and improve the car's efficiency.</li>
    <li>Added a pointed tip for aerodynamics.</li>
    <li>Sanded the back to allow wind to roll off easier.</li>
    <li>Finally, added some aesthetic features.</li>
  </ul>
