<h3 id="explanation-of-the-project-">Explanation of the Project:</h3>
<p>This project was my culminating project for grade 9 TEJ10R, where we had to create a dragster out of foam. This car needed to have the least amount of friction and be as aerodynamic as possible. To build this, we first had to research what makes a car aerodynamic and what makes it go as fast. Then we were to make our design on Onshape, and finally, we built it. </p>

<h2 id="research-">Research:</h2>
<p>While researching, one of the cars that stood out the most was the <strong>McLaren Speedtail</strong> and the <strong>Tatra T77A</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>The Speedtail was low to the ground and was thin.  </li>
<li>The Tatra was smooth and had a rounded back.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these designs, I made some drawings and went on to create the design on <strong>Onshape</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="final-product-">Final Product:</h2>
<p>My first copy was exactly like the OnShape design I had made. However, it did not perform adequately in the trials, so I lowered the weight and size. Thus I made some adjustments. </p>
<h3 id="improvements-made-from-original-">Improvements Made From Original:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sanded the corners to reduce drag and improve the car&#39;s efficiency.  </li>
<li>Added a pointed tip for aerodynamics.  </li>
<li>Sanded the back to allow wind to roll off easier.  </li>
<li>Finally, added some aesthetic features.  </li>
</ol>
