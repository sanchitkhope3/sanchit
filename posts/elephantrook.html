    <h1>TEJ Chess Piece</h1>

    <h2>Name: Sanchit</h2>

    <h3>Explanation of the Project:</h3>
    <p>
        We were assigned to recreate and design a new chess piece based on different cultures around the world. My chosen culture was the Indian culture where chess was incredibly popular. In that culture, the rook was known as an elephant, which I designed.

    <h2>Planning Stage:</h2>
    <p>
        I first researched different chess pieces and selected two: the knight and the rook. This was due to the amount of designs I could make with them.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the knight, I had chosen to design it based on the Maratha King, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. However, as a beginner to Onshape, it was too difficult for me to design.
    </p>
    <p>
        The rook, however, became an elephant that I could design. This was based on common chess boards in medieval India.

    <h3>Designing Stage:</h3>
    <p>
        To design it on my own, I used some online articles for reference. In this project, I utilized Onshape tools such as fillets, helix, sweeps, face blends, and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        I decided to put a castle on top of the elephant, as during wars, elephants were used to carry soldiers.
