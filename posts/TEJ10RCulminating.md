# TEJ Culminating Dragster

## Name: Sanchit Khope

### Explanation of the Project:
This project was my culminating project for grade 9 TEJ10R, where we had to create a dragster out of foam. This car needed to have the least amount of friction and be as aerodynamic as possible. To build this, we first had to research what makes a car aerodynamic and what makes it go as fast. Then we were to make our design on Onshape, and finally, we built it.

## Research:
While researching, one of the cars that stood out the most was the **McLaren Speedtail** and the **Tatra T77A**. 

- The Speedtail was low to the ground and was thin.  
- The Tatra was smooth and had a rounded back.  

Based on these designs, I made some drawings and went on to create the design on **Onshape**.

## Final Product:
My first copy was exactly like the OnShape design I had made. However, it did not perform adequately in the trials, so I lowered the weight and size. 

### Improvements Made:
1. Sanded the corners to reduce drag and improve the car's efficiency.  
2. Added a pointed tip for aerodynamics.  
3. Sanded the back to allow wind to roll off easier.  
4. Finally, added some aesthetic features.
